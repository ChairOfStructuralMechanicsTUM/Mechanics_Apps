# Collision application

n the following app, The moving boat with its swimmers on board represent the principle of conservation of momentum; 
that is the total momentum of the system (system here means both the boat and the swimmers) is conserved. 
When one of the swimmers jumps to the right, it recieved momentum to the right; 
however, the boat at the same instant recieves the same amount of momentum in the left direction, which results eventually to a zero additional momentum. 


## To Do
- [ ] Momentum of boat not changing when people jum and velocities stays constant
- [ ] For 3 and 5 people the figures of people are not symmetric wrt the boat
