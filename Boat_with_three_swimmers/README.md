# Collision application

In the following app, The moving boat with its swimmers on board represent the principle of conservation of momentum; 
that is the total momentum of the system (system here means both the boat and the swimmers) is conserved. 
When one of the swimmers jumps to the right, it recieved momentum to the right; 
however, the boat at the same instant recieves the same amount of momentum in the left direction, which results eventually to a zero additional momentum. 


## To Do
- [x] Momentum of boat is not changing when people jump and velocities stays constant (Problem of Phyton Versions 2.7 vs 3.5)
- [x] For 3 and 5 people the figures of people are not symmetric wrt the boat (also phyton versions...)
- [x] Absolute speed of swimmer after jump = speed of boat before jump - relative speed of jumper
- [x] Vizualisation of relative and absoulte speed of jumper in comparison to absolute speed of boat in a diagram with arrows
- [x] Legend for the velocity diagram 
- [x] Use scaling factor of 1.3 for velocities in diagram in order to use the whole vertical axis and improve the optical apperence of the arrows (ratio of their length to the size of their arrow heads)
- [x] Improve optics:

        - Drawing with "technical data": 
          vector grafics, 
          colors and aspect ratio of person and boat equal to water scene,
          drawing should be placed under velocity diagram or sliders
        - Line width of describtion should be equal (or better little less) than width of "scene"
        - width of sliders + velocity diagram should be equal to width of "scene"
