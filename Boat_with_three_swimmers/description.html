<h1>Boat with Swimmers on Board</h1>

<p>
In the following app, The moving boat with its swimmers on board represent the principle of conservation of momentum; that is the total momentum of the system (system here means both the boat and the swimmers) is conserved. When one of the swimmers jumps to the right, it recieved momentum to the right; however, the boat at the same instant recieves the same amount of momentum in the left direction, which results eventually to a zero additional momentum.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been modelled:
</p>

<p>
----- The application can be paused, reset, and re-played countless number of times
</p>
<p>
----- The number of swimmers on board can be modified whenerver the application is paused or reset using the slider of "Number of swimmers on board" at the bottom left
</p>
<p>
----- The information regarding the velocities of both boat and swimmers can be found in the velocity diagram below.
