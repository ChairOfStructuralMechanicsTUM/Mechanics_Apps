# Collision application

Prototype of a WebApp demonstrating energy variation via Bokeh for the lectures at the Chair of Structural Mechanics, Prof. Müller, TUM (Technische Universität München).


## To Do
- [x] Right wall does not behave elastically when restitution coeff. is 0. The other walls work fine.
- [x] Slider for velocity of green particle has no effect
- [x] Reset Button does not affect the coefficient of restitution - by intention
- [x] If velocity of red ball is set !=0: One click on the Reset button moves the slider to "0" but changes the velocity to "1". A second click on Reset changes also the velocity to "0"
