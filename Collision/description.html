<h1>Elastic to Inelastic (Plastic) Collisions</h1>

<p>
In the following app, the collision of two masses is simulated interactively. This collision phenomenon has been modeled using Newton's laws of motion in addition to the collision formula, which is meant to conserve the total momentum of the two particles system and some or total of the kinetic energy depending on the Coefficient of Resistution). For more information, please consider visiting the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inelastic_collision
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been modelled:
</p>

<p>
----- The location of the two particles can been modified by clicking and draging the particle to the desired location
</p>
<p>
----- The velocity direction of the two particles can be modified using the velocity direction sliders on the right, which can vary between 0 degrees to 360 degrees (The arrows on particles visualize the velocity magnitude and direction)
</p>
<p>
----- The velocity magnitude of the two particles can be modified using the velocity magnitude sliders on the right, which can vary between 0 degrees to 5 m/sec 
</p>
<p>
----- The Coefficient of Restitution can be modified using the Coefficient of Resistution slider on the right, which can vary between 0 (fully inelastic/plastic) and 1 (fully elastic)
</p>
