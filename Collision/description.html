<h1>Elastic to Inelastic (Plastic) Collisions</h1>

<p>
In the following app, the collision of two particals with different mass is simulated interactively. This collision phenomenon has been modeled using Newton's laws of motion in addition to the collision formula. Therefore the total momentum of the two particles is conserved and - depending on the coefficient of restitution - some or total of the kinetic energy is conserved. For more information, please consider the chapter "Der gerade zentrale Stoss" in the lecture notes of the technical mechanics supplementary module or visit this link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inelastic_collision" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. This laws of collision are applied to the normal components of the velocities of the particles, if the velocities of the particles are not in same direction. The tangential components remain unchanged.
</p>

<p>
We have implemented the following interactivities in this application:
</p>
<p>
- The simulation can be started and paused unlimited number of times with the play/pause-button. 
</p>
<p>
- The location of the two particles can been modified - while in pause mode - by clicking and draging the particles to the desired location.
</p>
<p>
- The velocity direction and magnitude of the two particles can be modified - while in pause mode - using the velocity sliders. 
</p>

<p>
- The coefficient of restitution can be modified with a slider, which can vary between 0 (fully inelastic/plastic) and 1 (fully elastic). (This coefficient effects only the collision between the particles. The collision of a particle with a wall is always elastic.)
