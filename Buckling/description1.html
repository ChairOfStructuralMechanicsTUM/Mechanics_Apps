<h1>Column Buckling with different Boundary Conditions</h1>

<p>
In the following app, four columns with different boundary conditions are subjected to the same compressive load.
As the load increases, the columns suddenly transition from a <bold>stable</bold> mode of deformation to an <bold>unstable</bold> mode of deformation resulting in the phenomenon known as buckling.
Buckling depends on many different factors such as shape, length, and elasticity of the column. </p>

<p>Important properties to note:</p>
<ul>
<li> The length of the Free-Fixed column is \(L\). Each subsequent column is a multiple of \(L\). </li>
<li> All measurements and calculations are dimensionless.
  The lengths have all been normalized with respect to \(L\) and the loads \(F\) have been normalized with respect to the critical load \(F_{crit}\). </li>
<li> The columns all have the same modulus of elasticity and the same moment of inertia.
  In other words, aside from their respective lengths, the columns are all the same in material and shape. </li>
<li> The way in which a column will buckle is determined by the boundary conditions. </li>
<li> The Force Ratio slider can only go one way.
  Once the beams have buckled, click the Reset button to reset the figure to the original state.</li>
</ul>
