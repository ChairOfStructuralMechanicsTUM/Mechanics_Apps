<h4> Euler Buckling Equation </h4>
<p>
  Buckling can be modeled by a second order differential equation known as the Euler Buckling Equation:
    $$ EI {d^4 w \over dx^4} + F{d^2 w \over dx^2} = 0 $$

</p>

<p>
  The solution of this differential equation can be represented in the form of sines and cosines:
  $$ w = A \sin{\sqrt{ {F \over EI}} x  } + B \cos{\sqrt{ {F \over EI} } x} + Cx + D $$
</p>

<p>
  Where constants $A,B,C,D$ are determined by the boundary conditions of the column.
</p>


In order to determine the maximum load a column can withstand before buckling, one can utilize the 'Euler' Formula at the critical load (the lowest value) and obtain:
$$ F_{crit} = { c \pi^2 E I \over L^2 } $$
<p> Where: </p>
<ul>
<li> \(F_{crit}\) is the calculated critical force where buckling will occur.</li>
<li> \(E\) is the modulus of elasticity of the material.</li>
<li> \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the cross section of the column. </li>
<li> \(L\) is the length of the column.</li>
<li> \(c\) is the column effective length factor. \(c\) changes with the boundary conditions and is the governing parameter in this application.</li>
</ul>

<p>
 \(c\) varies for each boundary condition. The boundary conditions used in this app have the following values:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Free-Fixed:      \(c = 1/4\) </li>
<li> Pinned-Pinned:   \(c = 1\) </li>
<li> Pinned-Fixed:    \(c = 2\) </li>
<li> Fixed-Fixed:     \(c = 4\) </li>
</ul>

<!-- bifurcation plot excluded - just adds a lot of confusion? - maybe think of another description
<p>Buckling can be described mathematically as a bifurcation in the solution to the equations of static equilibrium (see bifurcation plot).
The bifurcation plot shows the displacement \(w\) (normalized to \(L\)). </p>
