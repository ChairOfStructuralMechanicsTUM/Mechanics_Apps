<h1>Rolling Test</h1>

<p>
This app compares the rolling speed of different objects at different angles.
</p>

<p>
There are both hollow and full objects at choice and any can be compared to each other.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to choose different radii from 1 to 4 meters in step sizes of 0.5 meters. Additionally one can chose an inner radius for hollow objects. This option will only appear in case of a hollow object being actually selected.
</p>

<p>
The $\alpha$-sliders change the slope of each ramp individually from 5 to 25 degrees.
</p>

<p>
In the stopping mode "one", the simulation runs until the first object hits the end of the ramp. All other objects will stay at their current position on the ramp.
That way, comparisons regarding the traveled distance can be made easily.
However, one can still click the start button after the simulation has ended to run it until the next object hits the end.
</p>

<p>
Another option of the stopping mode is "all". This will force all objects to roll until the very end of the ramp.
The end time will be displayed in each plot, making a comparison of the total rolling times possible.
</p>

<p>
If all options have been set, one can press the start button to run the simulation. It can be stopped at any time by clicking on the stop button (which will appear only during simulation runs!).
To continue the simulation, the start button has to be pressed again.
All settings are fixed during a simulation run and cannot be changed!
</p>

<p>
In order to place the objects back on their starting positions and change the settings, please use the reset button.
All chosen options and selections will stay the same, so you don't have to repeat every single change again.
For the standard values of the sliders and selections, please reload the page. </br>
Do NOT reload the page during a simulation run! Wait, until all objects stopped moving.
</p>
