<h1>Moment generated by two forces</h1>

<p>
    The following app shows the effect of two forces acting on a structure. Both forces are oriented in the same
    direction and the structure is supported between the forces at point $A$. In order to stay
    in equilibrium, a change of the position of the support must be conpensated by a change of the force amplitudes.
</p>

<p>
    At the support, both forces $F_1, F_2$ generate a moment of $400\,\mathrm{Nm}$, each in oppositing direction. The length between the left end of the structure and the support position $a$ can be changed
    using the slider on the right. In order to maintain equilibrium, the moments generated by the forces must have the same absolute value. The equilibrium is defined as
    \[ \sum M_A:\quad F_1a = F_2b \]
    with $b$ being the distance from support to the right end of the structure.
</p>

<p>
    The values of $F_1$ and $F_2$ can be displayed using the "Show values" button.
