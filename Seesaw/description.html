<h1>Moment generated by two forces</h1>

<p>
    The following app shows the effect of two forces acting on the two ends of a $40\,\mathrm{m}$ long beam. Both forces are oriented in the same
    direction and the beam is simply supported between the forces at point $A$. The length between the left end of the structure and the support position $a$ can be changed
    using the slider on the right.
    
</p>

<p>
    In order to maintain equilibrium, the moments generated by the forces must have the same absolute value. The equilibrium is defined as
    \[ \sum M_A:\quad F_1a = F_2 (l-a). \]
    According to the equilibrium a change of the position of the support must be compensated by a change of the force amplitudes. 
</p>

<p>
    The values of $F_1$ and $F_2$ can be displayed using the "Show values" button.
