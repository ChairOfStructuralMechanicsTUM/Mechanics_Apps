<h1>Beam Forces</h1>

<p>
This app visualizes the forces acting in a loaded beam.
The beam is double supported, whereby the support on the left is fixed and the right one movable.
Beneath the main plot, both shear stresses and torque are visualized troughout the length of the beam.
The user has the options to choose between a single load, a linear load and a triangular load. Different positions of the load and its direction can be set by
changing the sliders on the left of the plots. With another slider, the position of the movable support can be varied. Here, if the position of the 
movable support is set to zero, the beam will be supported in form of a cantilever. 
With a click on the respective additional buttons, the forces acting on the supports can be plotted or hidden or the setup will be resetted.
