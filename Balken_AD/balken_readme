To Do:
-Fix arrows check
-Fix shear equation CHECK
-add triangles to the support beams CHECK
-change colors to TUM colors
-

Translations:
-Biegemoment: Bending Moment
-Querkraft: Lateral Force? Shear
-Doppeltgelagerter Balken und Einzellast: Double bearing beam and single cell
-Lagerposition: Position of b
-Laenge zu Hoehe: Length to Height ratio

-Biegelinie: Buffer-line?
-Mit Schub: with thrust?

There is a beam: side A is fixed. Side B location can be changed by the slider. The animation takes the following inputs:
	-Location of side B
	-Magnitude of Force F
	-Location of Force F

The outputs of the animation:
	-Magnitude of Force at B
	-Magniture of Force at A
	-Bending moment
	-Lateral Force?	==> shear?

function for:
	-Magnitude of Force at B
	-Magnitude of Force at A
	-Shear
	-Moment
