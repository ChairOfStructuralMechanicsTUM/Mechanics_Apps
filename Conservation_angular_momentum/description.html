<h1>Conservation of Angular Momentum</h1>

<p>
In the following app, the principle of conservation of angular momentum is demonstrated 
in action using two bodies which can rotate freely relative to each other. The angular 
momentum <b>L</b> is defined as the product of the angular moment of inertia <b>&Iota;</b> and the
angular velocity of an object <b>&omega;</b>:

</center>
</p>

<p>
The angular momentum is constant for an isolated system, its direction and amplitude are steady. Therefore, if one part of the system 
is given an angular momentum in one direction, the other part of the system will have the same angular momentum in the opposite direction.

</p>

<p>
If a person standing in the middle of the blue wheel pushes to turn the 
surrounding rectangular green base, both parts will end up rotating opposite to each other 
with a net angular momentum to an observer sitting in an inertial frame of 
reference equal to zero. This also applies to a person standing in the 
rectangular base that pushes against the wheel.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the user will play the role of a person standing on the wheel.
Hence, he would be able to push against the rectangular base and rotate relative
to it. In order to do that, the user needs to follow the next steps:
</p>

<p>
1. Press the 'Play' button.
<br>2. Click and drag the cursor over the green rectangular base at the bottom left 
side of the page to get the objects to rotate. You can change the direction 
and the speed of rotation with the movement of the cursor.
<br>3. Use the 'Pause' button to stop the rotation of the objects and the 'Play' 
button to start it again. By using the 'Reset' button, the system gets back to the
initial position.
</p>

<p>
The user can track the angular momentum of both objects and check also whether 
the angular momentum of the total system, both wheel and rectangular base,
remains zero. This can be seen in the bar chart at the bottom of the page.
