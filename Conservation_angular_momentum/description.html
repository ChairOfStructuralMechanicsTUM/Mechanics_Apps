<h1>Conservation of Angular Momentum</h1>

<p>
In the following app, The conservation of angular momentum principle is demonstrated 
in action using two bodies which can rotate freely relative to each other. The angular 
momentum is defined as the product of the object angular moment of inertia and its
angular velocity.
If a person standing on the wheel in the middle pushes to turn the 
surrounding rectangular base, both will end up rotating opposite to each other 
with a net angular momentum to an observer setting in an inertial frame of 
reference equals to zero. This also applies to a person standing on the 
rectangular base and pushes against the wheel.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been modelled:
</p>

<p>
----- The user will play the role of a person standing on the wheel. Hence, the
user would be able to push against the rectangular base and ending up rotating 
relative to it. This push is modelled as a click and drag of the cursor upon the
rectangular base. If the person while rotating graps the rectangular base again,
both will come to a complete stop. Before the user is able to do this, the user 
must first click on the Play bottun.
</p>

<p>
----- The user should first press Play to be able to rotate the objects. Later,
the user can either pause the objects from rotating, and then press Play again
to continue the rotation or simply reset the whole setup and start from scratch
</p>

<p>
----- The user can track the angular momentum of both objects and check also whether 
the total system of both wheel and rectangular base angular momentum remains zero. This can
be seen from the bar chart in the bottom right.
