<h1>Moment_a_Free_Vector</h1>

<p>
The following app gives introduction to Moment Couple .It explains why the moment produced by equal and opposite Forces is called Free vector.
</p>

<p>
Couple is a system of forces with resultant Moment but without resultant Force.In rigid body mechanics, force couples are free vectors, 
meaning their effects on a body are independent of the point of application.

</p>

<p>
--- Here the Moment produced by the given Force couple is found out at different Locations. The Forces produce a Moment of 20Nm at the location of application as well as any point on the rigid body
