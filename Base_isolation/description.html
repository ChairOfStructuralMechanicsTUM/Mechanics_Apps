<h1>Building with base isolation under seismic loading</h1>

<p>
In this application, the maximum deformation of a building with base isolation subjected to seismic loading is simulated.  
The seismic load is defined according to the Eurocode 8, German Annex, and it is shown in terms of spectral accelerations.
Different parameters such as earthquake zones, importance coefficient and underground parameter, influnce the amplitudes and shape of the spectrum.
The governing equation of motion of the building are solved using the response spectrum analysis. 
The app shows the eigenfrequencies, the natural mode shapes and the maximum deformation of the system, with and without base isolation.
</p>

<p>
In this app, the following interactivities have been implemented:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The mass of the floors can be modified using the mass input box.</li>
    <li>The bending stiffness ($EI$) of each side wall can be modified using the bending stiffness input box.</li>
    <li>The earthquake zone, the importance coefficient and the underground parameter can be changed on the right next to the Elastic Response Spectrum plot. Whenever those paramters are changed, the user should hit the "Re-calculate Elastic Response Spectrum" button to re-draw the spectrum.</li>
    <li>To solve the problem hit the button "Solve System". This should be reapeted whenever the user changes the input parameters.</li>
</ul>
