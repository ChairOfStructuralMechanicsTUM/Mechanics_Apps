<h1>The couple-moment</h1>

<p>
    The following app gives an introduction to the concept of moment generated by a couple.
    A couple is formed by any two equal parallel forces with opposite senses.
    This app shows how different couples can produce the same moment vector.
</p>

<p>
    The forces $P_1$ and $P_2$ together generate a moment of 400 Nm at the pivot. The position of the forces $F_1$ and
    $F_2$ can be changed using the slider on the right.
    By decreasing the distance between the couple $F_1$ and $F_2$, the amplitude of the force needs to
    be increased in order to balance the couple-moment of the couple $P_1$ and $P_2$.
    The corresponding change in the magnitude of the forces is visualised.
