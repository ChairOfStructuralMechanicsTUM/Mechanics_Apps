<h1>Moment generated by pairs of forces</h1>

<p>
    The following app gives an introduction to the concept of a moment generated by a pair of forces.
    This pair is formed by two parallel forces with the same value but opposite direction.
    This app shows how different pairs can produce the same moment vector.
</p>

<p>
    The forces $P$ generate a moment of $400\,$Nm at the pivot. The position $b$ of the force pair $F$ can be changed using the slider on the right.
    By decreasing the distance between the pair $F$, the amplitude of the forces needs to
    be increased in order to balance the moment generated by the pair $P$:
    \[ \curvearrowright\sum M = 2Pa - 2Fb = 0.  \]
    The corresponding change in the magnitude of the forces is visualised.
