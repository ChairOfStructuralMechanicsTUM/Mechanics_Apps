# Spring pendulum/Federpendel App

Prototype of a WebApp demonstrating a Spring Pendulum via Bokeh for the lectures at the Chair of Structural Mechanics, Prof. Müller, TUM (Technische Universität München).

The app can be run using the command "bokeh serve --show Federpendel/" from the parent directory.

## To Do

- [x] Clarify initial velocity: The default should be "0". Should produce a horizontal tangent at t=0. Works fine after the app is initialized. Does not work after Stopp or Reset is clicked.
