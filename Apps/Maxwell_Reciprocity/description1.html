 <h4> Theory </h4>
 <p>
   In order to prove the reciprocal nature of two loads, consider a simple linear beam with a force $F_{1}$ at point $1$ and another force $F_{2}$ at point $2$ .
</p>
   <ul>
   <li> Let $F_{1}$ at point $1$ produce a deflection $w_{12}$ at point $2$ and a deflection $w_{11}$ at point $1$.</li>
   <li> Let $F_{2}$ at point $2$ produce a deflection $w_{21}$ at point $1$ and a deflection $w_{22}$ at point $2$.</li>
   <li> Let the total resultant work done be the same, regardless if $F_{1}$ is applied first or if $F_{2}$ is applied first. ( $W_{1} = W_{2}$ ) </li>
   <li> Let both forces be equal ($F_{1} = F_{2}$ ) </li>
   </ul>

<p>
  Since the total work will be the same independent of whether $F_{1}$ or $F_{2}$ is applied to the beam first, the work can described in the following way:
</p>
  <ul>
   <li> Case 1: $W_{1}$ is the work when $F_{2}$ is applied first and then $F_{1}$ is applied. </li>
   <li> Case 2: $W_{2}$ is the work when $F_{1}$ is applied first and then $F_{2}$ is applied. </li>
   <li> After both forces have been applied, it is easy to see that $W_{1} = W_{2}$ in both cases.
  </ul>

<p>
  By setting the work equal to each other, we end up with the following equations:
  \[ W_{1} = {1/2} F_{2} w_{22} + 1/2 F_{1} w_{11} + F_{2} w_{12} \]
  \[ W_{2} = 1/2 F_{1} w_{11} + 1/2 F_{2} w_{22} + F_{1} w_{21} \]
  \[ 1/2 F_{2} w_{22} + 1/2 F_{1} w_{11} + F_{2} w_{12} = 1/2 F_{1} w_{11} + 1/2 F_{2} w_{22} + F_{1} w_{21} \]

  If both Force magnitudes are equal, the equation can be simplified to the final form:

  \[ w_{12} = w_{21} \]

</p>
