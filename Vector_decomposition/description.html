<h1>Vector Decomposition</h1>

<p>
    The following app demonstrates the decomposition of a vector into two components. A vector of arbitraty angle and
    magnitude can be defined and its components with respect to two chosen directions can be viewed.
</p>

<p>
    The directions in which the vector should be decomposed can be chosen using the sliders for $\alpha_1$ and
    $\alpha_2$. The magnitude \( |F| \) and direction \( \theta \) of the vector to be decomposed can be varied using
    the respective sliders. The components $F_1$ and $F_2$ and their absolute values can be revealed with the "Show
    components" button. In addition, there is a reset button to reset the plot.
