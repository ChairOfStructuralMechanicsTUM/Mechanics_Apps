<h1>Vectorial Translation</h1>

<p>
This app visualizes the vectorial characteristics of translation, velocity and acceleration.
</p>

<p>
Where do you have to aim the banana gun in order to launch a banana to feed the monkey, that drops from a tree-limb at the moment the banana is launched? The vertical component of the acceleration (gravity) is same  for the monkey and for the banana, after it is launched. Therefore, the monkey falls at the same rate as the banana falls below the straight dashed line (the gravity-free trajectory).  You will always succeed in feeding the monkey as long as the gravity-free trajectory will intersect the monkey before the gun is fired and as long as the initial velocity is high enough, so that the banana has reached the monkey before it hits ground.
</p>

<p>
The horizontal component of the banana's velocity is not influenced by gravity. The banana flies the further the lower gravity is (assuming same initial velocity and angle).
</p>

<p>We allow the modification of the</p>
<ul>
<li> inclination angle of the gun.</li>
<li> initial velocity of the banana.</li>
<li> mass of the banana. (Which has no influence on the path of the banana, it just increases the kinetic energy of the banana.)</li>
<li> the height of the gun base.</li>
</ul>
