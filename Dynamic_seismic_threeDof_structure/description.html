<h1>Building under Seismic Loading</h1>

<p>
In this application, the maximum deformation a building can encounter under a seismic loading is to be modelled. First, the governing equation of motion of the building will be determined. Then, a modal analysis will be performed upon this system of equations and the the corresponding eigenfrequencie and eigen-modeshapes are plotted. At the end, the maximum deformation of the building is to be determined based on standard codes for seismic loading on buildings.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been implemented:
</p>

<p>
----- The mass of each floor can be modified using the mass input box
</p>
<p>
----- The bending stiffness (EI) of each side wall can be modified using the bending stiffness input box
</p>
<p>
----- The deformed or undeformed configuration of the building can be visualized using their corresponding buttons
</p>
<p>
----- The corrsponding seismic related parameters can be changed on the right next to the Elastic Response Spectrum plot. Whenever those paramters are changed, the user should hit the "Re-calculate Elastic Response Spectrum" button to re-draw the spectrum
</p>
<p>
----- The user should hit the button "Solve System" whenever the user want to update the modal parameters as well as the maximum deformation of the building according to the newly chosen values and parameters
