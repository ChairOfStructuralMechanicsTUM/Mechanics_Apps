# Parametrization of a curve w.r.t arc length

App, that visualizes the difference of a curve with arbitrary vs. arc length parametrization. This can be visualized through plotting of the tangent vector. Additionally one realizes the different mapping of parameter to R2 space.

- [x] change dropdown menu for parametrization type to checkboxes. Allows for better comparison, if normal parametrization is red and arc length blue. Let both parametrizations evolve simultanously.
- [x] add some sample functions
- [x] make app ready for **publication**
- [ ] add support for dynamic user view update
