<h1>Coriolis Force: Vizualisation of the path of a particle on a rotating disk with absence of Coriolis acceleration</h1>

<p>
In the following app we visualize the path which is drawn by a particle which moves with constant velocity $v_0$ (with respect to the inertial system, not with respect to the rotating system) on a rotating disk. 
</p>

<p>
The path drawn on the disk is in orange, while the path with respect to the inertial system is green. The later is a straight line, because the particle is not accelerated. The orange path (drawn on the rotating disk) is therefore curved. If the path on the rotating system shall be a straight line (e.g. in case the particle shall represent a train moving on straight tracks), the particle has to be accelerated by the Coriolis force. One can imagine with the help of this app in which direction the Coriolis force has to act.
</p>


<p>
We allow the modification of the rotational velocity $\omega$ of the disk and the two cartesian components of the particle velocity $v_0$ with respect to the inertial system. Furthermore, one can toggle the reference frame for the visualization between "Room" and "Disk". This will have no effect on the paths. In case "Room" the observer is next to the disk and looks on the rotating disk. In case "Disk" the observer stands on the disk and rotates with it.
