# Coriolis Force App / Drehscheibe-Corioliskraft App

Prototype of a WebApp demonstrating the Coriolis Force via Bokeh for the lectures at the Chair of Structural Mechanics, Prof. Müller, TUM (Technische Universität München).

The app can be run using the command "bokeh serve --show Drehscheibe-Corioliskraft/" from the parent directory.

## To Do
- [ ] translate buttons

## To Do ?
- [x] Deactivate v0 sliders when ball is moving (not currently possible with bokeh as Slider.deactivate is not correctly implemented)
