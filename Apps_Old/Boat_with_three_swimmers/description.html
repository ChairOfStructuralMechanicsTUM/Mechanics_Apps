<h1>Boat with Swimmers on Board</h1>

<p>
The following app with the moving boat and its jumping swimmers on board represents the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum of the system (both the boat and the swimmers) is conserved. When one of the swimmers jumps to the right, it receives momentum to the right. However, the boat (with the remaining swimmers on board) has to receive at the same instant the same amount of momentum in the left direction in order to maintain the same total momentum. The boat gets therefore accelerated. This acceleration is the bigger the less people are still on board.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been modelled:
</p>

<p>
- The application can be paused, reset, and re-played countless number of times.
</p>
<p>
- The number of swimmers on board can be modified whenever the application is paused or reset using the slider of "Number of swimmers on board" at the bottom left.
</p>
<p>
- Information regarding the velocities of both boat and swimmers can be found in the velocity diagram below.
</p>
<h2>Velocity Diagram</h2>
<p>
Under each set of arrows, the name of the corresponding identity is written. For the swimmers, the black arrow indicates the boat velocity which the swimmer jumped from. The grey arrow indicates the relative jumping velocity of the swimmer with respect to the boat. The third arrow is colored based on the color of its corresponding swimmer, and it indicates the final absolute velocity of the swimmer after jumping. For the boat, the black arrow indicates the absolute velocity of the boat and the colored arrows indicate the added velocity from the jumping swimmers (arrow colors correspond to the swimmers).
