 <h2> Theory </h2>
 <p>
   In order to prove the reciprocal nature of two loads, consider a simple linear beam with a force \(F_{1}\) at point \(i\) and another force \(F_{2}\) at point \(j\) .
</p>
   <ul>
   <li> Let \(F_{1}\) at point \(i\) produce a deflection \(w_{ji}\) at point \(j\) and a deflection \(w_{ii}\) at point \(i\).</li>
   <li> Let \(F_{2}\) at point \(j\) produce a deflection \(w_{ij}\) at point \(i\) and a deflection \(w_{jj}\) at point \(j\).</li>
   <li> Let the total resultant work done be the same, regardless if \(F_{1}\) is applied first or if \(F_{2}\) is applied first. ( \(W_{1} = W_{2}\) ) </li>
   <li> Let both forces be equal (\(F_{1} = F_{2}\) ) </li>
   </ul>

<p>
  Since the total work will be the same independent of whether \(F_{1}\) or \(F_{2}\) is applied to the beam first, the work can described in the following way:
</p>
  <ul>
   <li> Case 1: \(W_{1}\) is the work when \(F_{2}\) is applied first and then \(F_{1}\) is applied. </li>
   <li> Case 2: \(W_{2}\) is the work when \(F_{1}\) is applied first and then \(F_{2}\) is applied. </li>
   <li> After both forces have been applied, it is easy to see that \(W_{1} = W_{2}\) in both cases.
  </ul>

<p>
  By setting the work equal to each other, we end up with the following equations:
  $$ W_{1} = {1/2} F_{2} w_{jj} + 1/2 F_{1} w_{ii} + F_{2} w_{ji} $$
  $$ W_{2} = 1/2 F_{1} w_{ii} + 1/2 F_{2} w_{jj} + F_{1} w_{ij} $$
  $$ 1/2 F_{2} w_{jj} + 1/2 F_{1} w_{ii} + F_{2} w_{ji} = 1/2 F_{1} w_{ii} + 1/2 F_{2} w_{jj} + F_{1} w_{ij} $$

  If both Force magnitudes are equal, the equation can be simplified to the final form:

  $$ w_{ji} = w_{ij} $$
