    <h1>Tensions on the cable car transportation system </h1>
    
    <p>
        In the cable car transportation system, the hanging transport containers are moved up and down with help of a traction cable. The cable must support the weight of the car ($W=Mg$) and also pull it at a constant speed ($v$). As the car moves along the cable of length ($L$), the angular orientation of the bottom ($\theta_1$) and the top ($\theta_2$) cable segments also varies accordingly. Because of this variation of the cable segment angles, the tensions on the top and bottom of a cable would also vary respectively. This interactive web app computes the cable tensions on top ($T_2$) and the bottom ($T_1$) of the carriage car at user defined horizontal position ($x$).

       The kinematic configuration of the cable car system at a given horizontal position of the carriage is shown below:
