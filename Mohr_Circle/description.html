<h1>Mohr's Circle</h1>

<p>
This app visualizes Mohr's Circle.
It explains how the Mohr Circle can be used to identify the different stresses that act on a differential element with variable orientation.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been modelled:
</p>

<p>
The normal stresses in x- and in z-direction can be changed, as well as the tangential stress.<br> 
After selecting the initial stress state, a click on "Draw" shows Mohr's Circle. Visualized are the normal stresses $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$, the shear stress $\tau_{xz}$ and the current stress state $A$. A click on "Show principal stress + direction" reveals the principal stresses $\sigma_I$ and $\sigma_{II}$, the center of Mohr's Circle $\sigma_M$, and the principal stress angle $\alpha_0$.<br>
The element can be rotated in the third figure, resulting in the stress state $B$. It can be observed, that the shear stresses vanish, if the element is rotated according to $\alpha_0$. The current normal stresses $\sigma_{\overbar{x}}$ and $\sigma_{\overbar{z}}$ can also be seen in the plot visualizing Mohr's Circle.
