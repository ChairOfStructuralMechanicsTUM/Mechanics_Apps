    <h1>Beam Modes</h1>
    
    <p>
        This app shows the deflection of a harmonically loaded beam for different boundary conditions. The force amplitude $F$ is fixed, as well as the length $L$, the real part of the Young's modulus $E'$, the area moment of inertia $I$ and the mass per unit length $\mu$ of the beam.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deflection can be calculated with the following equation: $$W\left(x\right) = C_1 \cdot sin\left(\frac{\lambda}{L} \cdot x\right) + C_2 \cdot cos\left(\frac{\lambda}{L} \cdot x\right) + C_3 \cdot sinh\left(\frac{\lambda}{L} \cdot x\right) + C_4 \cdot cosh\left(\frac{\lambda}{L} \cdot x\right),$$
        where $$\lambda = L \cdot \sqrt[4]{\frac{\mu \cdot \Omega^2}{E \cdot I}}$$ with $$E = E' + E'' \cdot i.$$
    </p>
    <p>
        The drop down menu allows to choose from four different support systems. Additionally, we allow the modification of
        <ul>
            <li> the loss modulus $E''$ in $\frac{N}{mÂ²}$ which is the imaginary part of the Young's modulus and which describes the energy loss and thus the damping of the material, </li>
            <li> the location of the load in $m$, </li>
            <li> the location of the frequency analysis in $m$, </li>
            <li> the excitation frequency $\Omega$ in $\frac{1}{s}$. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The plot on the upper left shows the chosen system and the deformed beam. The maximum deflection is normalized to a certain value.
        The diagram on the upper right shows the normalized deflection of the beam at the chosen location for a fixed range of excitation frequencies. 
        On the lower right the phase angle is plotted. The phase angle describes by how much the response lags behind the excitation.
        The green button allows the user to change between the frequency analysis and the modification of the input parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 3D plot at the bottom puts together the information displayed in the upper diagrams and shows the dependency between the excitation frequency, the eigenfrequencies of the system and the normalized deflection of the beam.
        One can pan to rotate the figure and scroll or pinch to zoom.
