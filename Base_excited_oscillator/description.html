            <h1>Base excited Oscillator</h1>
    
            <p>
            In structural dynamics often root point excited vibrations occur, e.g. for earthquakes or for a car that passes an uneven road.

            <p>
            This app shows the motion of a damped and base excited oscillator made up of a mass which is connected to the wheel via a spring-dashpot element.
            In the beginning, the mass is located at the position of static equilibrium. By starting the app, the wheel will start moving along the floor, which is described by a sine function, and the mass will start oscillating.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>We allow the modification of the</p>
            <ul>
            <li> mass in $kg$ </li>
            <li> spring stiffness in $\frac{N}{m}$ </li>
            <li> damping constant in $\frac{Ns}{m}$ </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The diagram shows the relative displacement of the mass (change in distance between mass and wheel) dependent on the time. The relative displacement consists of the homogeneous and the particular part.
            The total displacement of the mass can be calculated by adding the relative displacement to the displacement of the wheel.

            At the right-top corner of the diagram several tools allow to zoom in or to scroll forward in time. The reset button brings the system back to the initial settings.
