<h1>Column Buckling with different Boundary Conditions</h1>

<p>
In the following app, four columns with different boundary conditions are subjected to the same compressive load.
As the load increases, the columns suddenly transition from a <bold>stable</bold> mode of deformation to an <bold>unstable</bold> mode of deformation resulting in the phenomenon known as buckling.
Buckling depends on many different factors such as shape, length, and elasticity of the column. </p>

<h2> Euler Buckling Equation </h2>
<p>
  Buckling can be modeled by a second order differential equation known as the Euler Buckling Equation:
    $$ EI {d^2 w \over dx^2} + Pw = 0 $$

</p>

<p>
  The solution of this differential equation can be represented in the form of sines and cosines:
  $$ w = A \sin{\sqrt{ {P \over EI} x } } + B \cos{\sqrt{ {P \over EI} } x} + Cx + D $$
</p>

<p>
  Where constants A,B,C,D are determined by the boundary conditions of the column.
</p>


In order to determine the maximum load a column can withstand before buckling, one can utilize the 'Euler' Formula at the critical load (the lowest value) and obtain:
$$ P_{cr} = { c \pi^2 E I \over L^2 } $$
<p> Where: </p>
<ul>
<li> F is the calculated critical force where buckling will occur.</li>
<li> E is the modulus of elasticity of the material.</li>
<li> I is the moment of inertia of the cross section of the column. </li>
<li> L is the length of the column.</li>
<li> c is the column effective length factor. c changes with the boundary conditions and is the governing parameter in this application.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  c varies for each boundary condition. The boundary conditions used in this app have the following c-values:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Free-Fixed:      c = 1/4 </li>
<li> Pinned-Pinned:   c = 1 </li>
<li> Pinned-Fixed:    c = 2 </li>
<li> Fixed-Fixed:     c = 4 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Bifurcation Plot</h2>

<p>Buckling can be described mathematically as a bifurcation in the solution to the equations of static equilibrium (see bifurcation plot).
The bifurcation plot shows the displacement 'w' (normalized to L). </p>


<h2>Important properties to note:</h2>
<ul>
<li> The length of the Free-Fixed column is of length L. Each subsequent column is a multiple of L. </li>
<li> All measurements and calculations are dimensionless.
  The lengths have all been normalized with respect to L and the loads have been normalized with respect to the critical load. </li>
<li> The columns all have the same modulus of elasticity and the same moment of inertia.
  In other words, aside from their respective lengths, the columns are all the same in material and shape. </li>
<li> The way in which a column will buckle is determined by the boundary conditions. </li>
<li> The Force Ratio slider can only go one way.
  Once the beams have buckled, click the Reset button to reset the figure to the original state.</li>
</ul>
