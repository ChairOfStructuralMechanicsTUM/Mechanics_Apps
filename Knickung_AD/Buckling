Buckling: (Knickung)

Bifurkation - bifurcation

 - Buckling is the bifurcation (splitting) in the solution of static equilibrium
 - Boundary conditions determine the mode of bending of the column and the distance between inflection points on the displacement curve of the deflected column. The inflection points in the deflection shape of the column are the points at which the curvature of the column changes sign and are also the points at which the column's internal bending moments of the column are zero. The closer the inflection points are, the greater the resulting axial load capacity (bucking load) of the column.

F = pi^{2}*(E*I) / (K*L)^{2})

Animation Description:

There are 4 beams. Each beam has different boundary conditions:
	1. Beam is free at top end, fixed at bottom end.
	2. Beam is pinned at both ends. One pin is free to move vertically as force is applied.
	3. Beam is pinned at top end, fixed at bottom end. Pinned end moves with increase in force.
	4. Beam is fixed at both ends.

Force reaches critica
