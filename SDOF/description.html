<h1>Damped SDOF system </h1>

<p>
This app shows the motion of a classical single degree of freedom system, cosisting out of a discrete mass, a spring, and a damper element. A harmonic force can also be applied to the system.
By starting the oscillation, the system oscillates around the static equilibrium position at $u = 0$. The displacement plot is normalized with the spring stiffness. No gravity is acting on the system.

<p> The interactivity parameters are </p>
<ul>
<li> the mass in kg </li>
<li> the spring stiffness in N/m </li>
<li> the damping constant in Ns/m</li>
<li> the initial displacement of the mass in m</li>
<li> the initial velocity of the mass in m/s</li>
<li> the frequency ratio of eigenfrequency and excitation frequency</li>
<li> the harmonic force</li>
</ul>

<p>For high values of damping, the oscillation amplitude decays quickly and the system reaches its static equilibrium. Zero initial velocity means that the displacement starts with a horizontal tangent. </p> 

<p>If the system is subjected to a harmonic load, the solution consists out of two main parts: the homogeneous and the particular part. While the homogeneous part is transient and decays, if damping is present, the particular part is driven by the harmonic load and does not decay. For the case of a damped system, the total solution and the particular solution coincide after the homogeneous part has decayed completely. </p> 

<p>The diagrams on the far right show the amplification function and the phase angle of the system subjected to harmonic loading. The dot marks the current frequency ratio.</p>

<p>At the right-top corner of the displacement plot, several tools allow to zoom in or to scroll forward in time. 
The Pause button pauses the playback, the Stop button clears all time data and all settings are restored. </p>
