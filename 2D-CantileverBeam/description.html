<h1>Cantilever Beam</h1>

<p>
In the following app, The 3D cantilever beam has been modelled in two seperate 2D plots. The deformation the beams below are going to show is based on the solution of Euler-Bernouli Ordinary Differential Equation. The colors that will be seen in the plots correspond to the distribution of normal stresses.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been modelled:

----- The force acting in both the Y and Z directions can be varied using the corresponding two sliders below to the right.
