<h1>Rectilinear motion </h1>

<p> A car is driving towards a wall with a given initial velocity \(v_0\). The distance between the car and the wall is 30 m. 
At time \(t=0\) the car is at \(s=0\). You can input a constant acceleration (or deceleration) and by clicking the start button, the car moves according to the entered inputs.
The four plots show the dependency of the velocity \(v\) and the acceleration \(a\) on the time \(t\) as well as the dependency of the time \(t\) and the velocity \(v\)  on the distance \(s\) travelled by the car.
It shows the equations of \(s(t)\) and \(v(t)\) as a functions of the time \(t\). 
Finally, you can try to guess the equations which describe the time and the velocity as a function of the distance \(s\) and compare your guess with the computed curves using the check button.<p>

<p> The interactivity parameters are </p>
<ul>
<li> the initial velocity \(v_0\) in m/s, which can be switched to a distance-dependent velocity \(v(s)\), if the option is selected in the dropdown-list</li>
<li> the acceleration  \(a\) of the car in m/s^2 </li>
<li> check/uncheck the box for showing \(v(t)\) and \(a(t)\) </li>
<li> enter \(s\)-dependent equations and compare with the computed curves for  \(t(s)\) and  \(v(s)\)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if the initial velocity is 3 m/s and the constant acceleartion is equal to -0.15 m/s^2, the car will stop exactly right before the wall (at s=30 m). 
The time-dependent and distance-dependent quantities are shown in the plots. The equation for v(s) is \(\sqrt{2\cdot(-0.15 s)+9}\).   </p> 

<p>The reset button brings the system back to the initial settings. </p>
