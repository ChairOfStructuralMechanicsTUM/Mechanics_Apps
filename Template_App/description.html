<h1>Template</h1>

<p>
    This app provides a template for the fast start of developing a new app. <br>
    It can also be used as a reference resource for specific models when enhancing existing apps.
</p>


<h2>Directories</h2>

<h3>main.py - mandatory</h3>
<p>The main file where the magic of the app happens. <br>
   All other files will find together here, for example the description, images or helper functions. <br>
   Most importantly - apart from all the imports - the final page layout is set up in main.
</p>

<h3>description.html - mandatory</h3>
<p>An html-file describing the app. Must be loaded in main.py.<br>
   Multiple html-files for descriptions before, after or between certain plots/tools can also be used. <br>
   However the main description at the start of every app must always be provided.
</p>

<h3>constants.py</h3>
<p>All constants that are used throughout the app should be defined here. <br>
   Constants could be repeatedly used strings, initial slider settings, standard width and height for your widgets, image links, etc. <br>
   It is highly encouraged to include such a separate file for constants since it facilitates possible future adjustments without having to look through the rest of the code.
</p>

<h3>/static/images</h3>
<p>All images used in the app must be placed and loaded from here.</p>
