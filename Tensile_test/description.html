    <h1>Tensile test</h1>
    
    <p>
        This app visualizes the tensile test of three different materials. Tensile testing is a destructive test process, where a 
        sample is subjected to a controlled, unidirectional force until failure. This test provides information about various properties of the tested material.
    </p>

    <p>
        The user can choose from three different materials:
        <ul>
            <li> Steel: Ductile material with a pronounced yield strength. After reaching the tensile strength the sample begins to neck and the cross-section is reduced.  </li>
            <li> Rubber: Very elastic material that can undergo high deformations. When the sample is loaded and unloaded the stress-strain curve describes a hysteresis loop.</li>
            <li> Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP): Brittle material that breaks with little elastic deformation and without significant plastic deformation. The yield strength is not pronounced. </li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The deformation of the sample is shown in the left figure and the stress-strain diagram is plotted on the right.
