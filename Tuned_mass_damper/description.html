<h1>Tuned Mass Damper</h1>

<p>
Tuned Mass Damper is a dynamical system that consists of two masses, of which one has a bigger mass content and is fixed to the ground by a 
spring and the other has a smaller mass content and attached to the bigger mass by a spring and a damper. The bigger mass is referred to as the main mass, whereas the 
smaller mass is referred to as the top mass. The name Tuned Mass Damper was chosen because this application is 
meant to demonstrate how the adjustment of the top mass' mass amount, spring stiffness, and damping ratio can affect
the vibration pattern of the main mass.  
</p>
<p>
In this application, a time-varying force is acting directly upon the main mass. As a result, the displacement of the main mass
is plotted in the Displacement-Time Plot. Furthermore, the *Amplification Factor againts the *Frequency Ratio and the *Phase Angle againts the 
Frequency Fatio is plotted in the corresponding diagrams. 
</p>
*Amplification Factor: ratio between maximum displacement achieved by the main mass at a specific force frequency and the static displacement, which is simply the force amplitude divided by the main mass' spring stiffness
<p>
*Frequency Ratio: ratio between natural frequency of the main mass to the force frequency
</p>
<p>
*Phase Angle: describes by how much the response of the system lags the excitation. That is, for a zero phase angle,
the system's response is in phase with the excitation.
</p>

<p>
In this application, the following interactivities have been modelled:
</p>

<p>
----- In the Dynamical System diagram, both top and main masses can be seen along with the corresponding springs and damper.
In addition, the force vector that is acting on the main mass is implemented along with its value
</p>
<p>
----- In the Displacement-Time Plot, displacement of both main and top masses is plotted againts time
</p>
<p>
----- The value of mass in top mass is controlled by a slider located under System Parameters. Under System Parameters as well, there are 
two other sliders to control the value  stiffness and damping ratio of the spring and damper attached to the top mass
</p>
<p>
----- The angular frequency of the applied force can be modified by the slider found under External Force Parameters
</p>
<p>
----- The system can start moving by pressing the Play button, and it will pause by hitting the Stop button. the Clear Displacement-Time Plot button
clears the the corresponding plot area and returns the time count to 0 without affecting the current displacement of the Tuned Mass Damper System. 
The Reset button returns the Tuned Mass Damper system along with all the plots to the initial state
