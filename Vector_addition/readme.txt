Vector Addition App

Prototype of a WebApp demonstrating Addition of Two vectors via Bokeh for 
the lectures at the Chair of Structural Mechanics, Prof. Müller, TUM (Technische Universität München).

Vector magnitude and direction can be changed interactively using sliders and the resultant will be
displayed .

The app can be run using the command "bokeh serve --show VectorAddition" from the parent directory.
