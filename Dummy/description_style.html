<h3>Style Example</h3>

<p>
    In very rare cases you might need custom styles to enhance the appearance of your objects. <br>
    Most likely there already exists a dedicated attribute in new Bokeh versions which can be used directly in Python.
    However, sometimes such an attribute might still miss, therefore we present a short example on how to manipulate the style via the attribute css_classes since this
    is a more sophisticated approach that might not be clear when encountered for the first time.
</p>

<p>
    We need:
    <ul>
        <li>a callback function to change the css_classes</li>
        <li>a CSS style file located in /templates/styles.css</li>
        <li>an html index file located in /templates/index.html</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The names defined in css_classes have to appear in the styles.css in order to work. Have a look at the codes and files to see the connection. <br>
    Note how the colored background matches the size defined by width in the code.
