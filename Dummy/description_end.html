<h3>LaTeX/KaTeX and last steps</h3>

<p>
You might have noticed a bit of LaTeX in the descriptions. This is rendered due to a special package (KaTeX) which is imported in the main file.
It is not only possible to include LaTeX in the description text but also in the title of sliders, or legends and labels of plots. </br>
When updating the Bokeh version, you might have to adapt the custom LaTeX implementation in the shared folder.
See the <a href="https://github.com/ChairOfStructuralMechanicsTUM/Mechanics_Apps/wiki">Wiki</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least one of the most important parts to actually receive output and being able to look at the figures in your favorite browser lies in the command
curdoc().add_root(), where you can define the position of your objects (figures, sliders, buttons, etc.) by using rows and columns notation. </br>
Without this last step - opening the window to the outside world - all your programming and ideas would just stay imaginary.
</p>

<p>
We hope that we covered the most important underlying structures of the apps presented here and that the gained basis for programming in Bokeh will lead to magnificent creations. </br>
Copy the <a href="https://github.com/ChairOfStructuralMechanicsTUM/Mechanics_Apps/tree/master/Template_App">Template App</a> for a quick start and have a look at <a href="http://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference.html">Bokehs references</a> for other possible models that could not be covered here. <br>
Happy coding!
