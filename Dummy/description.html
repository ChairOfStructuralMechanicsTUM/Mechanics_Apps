<h1>Dummy App</h1>

<p>
This dummy app will show you how to program constantly recurring Bokeh models which can be found in most of the apps of this project. </br>
For a general overview of Bokeh, please consult the Wiki.
</p>


<h3>Inclination Example</h3>


<p>
First of all, let's start with a slider. Sliders can be used to dynamically change variables, and its effect is usually found in (several) plots. </br>
In this example, we will change the inclination of a line. All you need is
<ul>
    <li>a slider changing the angle $\alpha$</li>
    <li>a callback function which defines the new coordinates to plot based on $\alpha$</li>
    <li>a figure to show the output</li>
</ul>
</br>
To show the updated data and omit the old one, Bokeh uses a special type called <strong>ColumnDataSource</strong>. </br>
A detailed description of the underlying functions and programmatic structure can be found in the code itself.

Feel free to change, add or dismiss whatever you like. Learning by doing is the best kind of learning ;)
