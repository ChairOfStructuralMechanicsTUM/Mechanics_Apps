<p>
For this more sophisticated example of hiding a button, we need to dive a bit into CSS and JavaScript, since Bokeh does not offer yet a simple hide functionality.
</br>
We need:
<ul>
    <li>a (JavaScript) callback function</li>
    <li>a CSS style file located in /templates/styles.css</li>
    <li>an html index file located in /templates/index.html</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
All or the most bokeh models provide a css_classes attribute. </br>
Unfortunately, simply altering the css_classes attribute via hide_button.css_classes has no effect. That is why we need explicit JavaScript code which changes the
underlying CSS names of the object in question. </br>
UPDATE: It seems that now it is in fact possible to change the CSS classes without having to use a JavaScript function.
A normal callback function programmed in python like in the examples above will do.
</p>

<p>
Choose any tag, here "hidden" which should be present in the css_classes. The same tag is used in styles.css, so it is very important to not change this tag!
</p>

<p>
Of course we could also add some functionality to the button via callback functions like in the example above. </br>
For the purpose of providing a short overview we leave it this way without functionality. Nevertheless, feel free to try to expand or interconnect the examples. </br>
A good "real world" reference of the apps can be considered to be SDOF, since it provides a structure using classes, many sliders, buttons and animations.
