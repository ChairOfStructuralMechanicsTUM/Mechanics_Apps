<h3>Hide Example</h3>

<p>
    Sometimes hiding objects for specific settings becomes handy. Both the user experience improves and the app is less crowded. <br>
    Bokeh provides a simple way to achieve this. In old bokeh versions, one had to manipulate the objects via JavaScript and CSS. 
    Now it is enough to set the visible attribute accordingly.
</p>

<!-- <p>
For this more sophisticated example of hiding a button, we need to dive a bit into CSS and JavaScript, since Bokeh does not offer yet a simple hide functionality.
</br>
We need:
<ul>
    <li>a (JavaScript) callback function</li>
    <li>a CSS style file located in /templates/styles.css</li>
    <li>an html index file located in /templates/index.html</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
All or the most Bokeh models provide a css_classes attribute. </br>
Unfortunately, simply altering the css_classes attribute via hide_button.css_classes has no effect. That is why we need explicit JavaScript code which changes the
underlying CSS names of the object in question. </br>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> It seems that now it is in fact possible to change the CSS classes without having to use a JavaScript function.
A normal callback function programmed in Python like in the examples above will do.
</p>

<p>
Choose any tag, here "hidden", which should be present in the css_classes of objects you want to hide. The same tag is used in styles.css, so it is very important 
to keep consistent with the wording! </br>
In the defined callback function (see code), we can now easily change the css_classes attribute.
Depending on the names inside this attribute, the defined behavior in the styles file takes over. </br>
In case of choosing "show" in the slection below, the tag "hidden" is removed from the CSS classes of the button (if there), thus, the button is visible. </br>
Choosing "hide" will add the tag "hidden" and due to the styles file the button with this tag will not be displayed.
</p> -->

<p>
Of course we could also add some functionality to the button via callback functions like in the example above. </br>
For the purpose of providing a short overview we keep it this way without functionality. Nevertheless, feel free to try to expand or interconnect the examples. </br>
A good "real world" reference of the apps can be considered to be SDOF, since it provides a structure using classes, many sliders, buttons and animations.
