<h1>Wave Propagation</h1>

<p>
This app visualizes the wave propagation in a two-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, linear-elastic half-space with a vertically pulsating harmonic load.
It visualizes the total movement of particles in the soil and the displacement components of the potentials.
<img src="/Wave_Propagation/static/images/overview.PNG" width=700 align="right">
</p>

<p> The interactivity parameters are </p>
<ul>
<li> soil parameters: damping ratio for material damping $D$, Poisson's ratio $\nu$</li>
<li> load parameters: ecitation frequency $\Omega$, width $b$, amplitude $p_{0}$</li>
<li> plot area in $z$-direction</li>
<li> position of particle for which the potentials are displayed</li>
</ul>


</p>
<p>
The wave equation is given by Lam√©:
$$Gu^{i}\vert^{j}_{j}+(\lambda+G)u^{j}\vert^{i}_{j}-\rho\ddot{u}^{i} =0 \ \ \ \text{mit}\ i,j = x,y,z$$
The load is defined by the following equation:
$$P(x,t) = p_{1}(x) \cdot p_{2}(t) = \begin{cases} p_{0}\cos(\Omega t) & -b \leq x \leq b\\ 0 & x < -b \vee x > b \end{cases}$$
If there is no external stress $p_{0}=0$, only Rayleigh waves occur as result of the harmonic solution of the wave equation. 
The total shift is made up of the following potentials:
$$u = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \Psi_{y}}{\partial z}$$
$$w = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial \Psi_{y}}{\partial x}$$
</p>

<p>
The plot on the left shows 15 particles in x- and z-direction and the displacements in both plots are scaled for a clearer visualization.<br/>
The scaling factor is $\cdot (10^{6}\cdot |\Delta|\cdot \Omega)$ for $p_{0}=1$ and $\cdot (10^{2}\cdot |\Delta|\cdot \frac{1}{\Omega})$ for $p_{0}=0$. The variable $\Delta$ corresponds to the respective distance between the 
particles for $u$ in $x$-direction and for $w$ in $z$-direction.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The display of the plots can be changed by zooming in and out. The axes are given in meters and are not scaled.
</p>
<p>
The table above the plot on the left contains some calculation parameters, where lambda corresponds to the wavelength $\lambda$, c to wave velocity $c$ and G to shear modulus $G$.
The different types of P, S and R waves are given by the _p, _s and _r indices.
